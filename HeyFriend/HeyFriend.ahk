Look Friend, all I'm saying is this program is pretty powerful.
It's pretty fun to mess around with and does some cool stuff.
I've used it to automate all sorts of tasks because if can do clicks and, obviously, type also.
It's pretty cool.
I'm a fan.
This program, for example, took 4 lines that is NOT this particular text message. It's cool.
