#RandomAutohotkeyScripts
### by Logan Saso (aka JewsOfHazard)

These scripts are things I wrote for myself or friends either to have a bit of harmless fun or acomplish a task I wouldn't normally want to repeat over and over again. Some were written just to display the power of autohotkey with it's relative simplicity. ListenHere, OldMemes, Doggo, and HeyFriend were all just me showing off the power with a very little number of lines. Cenafy was made to mess with a friend. That's all that is written at the moment.
